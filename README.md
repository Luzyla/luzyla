## Hey! 👋 I'm Luzyla

A **Frontend Developer** with a scientific background and a natural curiosity for technology. Leveraging my expertise in React, TypeScript, and modern UI architectures, I focus on transforming concepts into high-performance, polished web interfaces. I'm dedicated to solving problems with a logical and structured approach, building solutions that are as robust on the inside as they are elegant on the outside.

My ultimate goal? **Bringing ideas to life with polished web interfaces.**

### Recent Challenges & Solutions

---

Recently, I’ve been improving my portfolio by tackling two key challenges. Each "problem" was an opportunity to learn and refine my skills:

- **Native Dark Mode:** Implementing this was more than just a color change. It required a full refactor to use **CSS variables** and **React `useState` and `useEffect`** hooks for dynamic theme handling.
- **Automated Deployment (CI/CD):** To avoid manual steps, I configured a **GitHub Actions workflow**. This automates the project build and deployment to my shared hosting via FTP, bypassing common infrastructure limitations.
